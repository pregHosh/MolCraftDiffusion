# Tutorial 6: Structure-Guided Generation

This tutorial explains how to guide molecule generation using structural constraints, such as filling in a missing piece (inpainting) or growing a molecule from a fragment (outpainting).

## Contents

1.  **Introduction**: The concept of guiding generation with a structural template.
2.  **Inpainting**: How to configure and run generation to fill in a missing portion of a molecule.
    *   Key configuration file: `configs/interference/gen_inpaint.yaml`
    *   Explanation of the input template file (see `assets/inpainting_template.xyz`).
3.  **Outpainting**: How to grow a molecule from a given substructure.
    *   Key configuration file: `configs/interference/gen_outpaint.yaml`
    *   Explanation of the input fragment file (see `assets/outpainting_template.xyz`).

## Assets

Example input files can be found in the `assets/` subdirectory.
