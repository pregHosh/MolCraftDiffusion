# Tutorial 7: Property-Directed Generation

This tutorial covers advanced generation techniques that steer the process towards desired chemical properties.

## Contents

1.  **Introduction**: The concept of directing generation with external models or guidance schemes.
2.  **Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)**: How to use CFG to amplify the effect of training conditions.
    *   Key configuration file: `configs/interference/gen_cfg.yaml`
3.  **Gradient Guidance (GG)**: How to use a trained regressor model (from Tutorial 2) to guide generation towards a specific property value.
    *   Key configuration file: `configs/interference/gen_gg.yaml`
4.  **Hybrid CFG/GG Guidance**: How to combine both CFG and GG for multi-objective guidance.
    *   Key configuration file: `configs/interference/gen_cfggg.yaml`
