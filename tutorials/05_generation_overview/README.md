# Tutorial 5: Generation Overview

This tutorial covers the fundamental methods for generating molecules with a trained diffusion model.

## Contents

1.  **Introduction**: An overview of the generation script and base configuration.
    *   Entry point: `scripts/generate.py`
    *   Base config: `configs/generate.yaml`
2.  **Unconditional Generation**: How to generate molecules without any conditions.
    *   Key configuration file: `configs/interference/gen_unconditional.yaml`
3.  **Conditional Generation**: How to provide conditions (e.g., number of atoms) that the model was trained on to guide generation.
    *   Key configuration file: `configs/interference/gen_conditional.yaml`
